## Step 1: Navigate to the project directory
I opened my powershell terminal and navigated to my ALX frontend project folder: 
> cd alx-intermediate-frontend

## Step 2: Create the SASS directory
I created a folder for this project called:
> mkdir 0x03-sass_scss

## Step 3: Install SASS
I installed SASS version globally using npm: 
> npm install -g sass

## Step 4: Verify installation
I checked the SASS version to confirm it installed successfully:
> sass --version
